# Workout Generator

## Purpose
During the times of the Corona virus, one of the things we can do to
strengthen ourselves is to exercise.

I like to exercise but sometimes I'd rather not have to come up with a
workout, so I end up doing unstructured physical exercise.

With this application, users will be able to contribute exercises
which will be stored in a Mongo Database. Users will also be able to
click a "Generate Workout" button that will generate a workout given which
part of the body the user wants to exercise. The workout will of course
use exercises from the database.

This is a free-to-use application which will hopefully be run with donations
from users. If all else fails, the application will be for personal use.
